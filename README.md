## Setup for Development
The setup process can be done locally, or the process can be done using a dev container. Either way works but it is easier to setup if you have WSL and Docker installed

### Dev Container (WSL)
1. Open repository in VSCode
2. As soon as VSCode opens, there should be a pop-up to reload project in dev container. If not, do (CTRL + SHIFT + P) and type `Dev container: rebuild and reload window`


### Local Developement
1. Open repository in VSCode
2. Create a new virutual environment: (CTRL + SHIFT + P) and type in "Create Virtual Env" and pick the default settings.
3. Inside your terminal, install the python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
